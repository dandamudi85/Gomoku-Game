# Gomoku-Game
Gomoku is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 15*15 grid. The player who succeeds in placing five of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
For example, X wins as below.

The Java program also records the winning history (how many X wins and how many O wins). The winning history is saved into a file. Whenever the game starts, the history will be loaded. There is a Reset button to reset the history (X wins = 0 and O wins = 0). There is also a Quit button to allow the users to quit the game. GUI example looks like:
